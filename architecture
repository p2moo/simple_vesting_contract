// Front End User Experience
======================================

1. Payer inputs end datetime, payee public key, and the amount of SOL he wishes to deposit
2. Payer presses deposit
3. Sign transaction

======================================
// Smart Contract Architecture
======================================

// Deposits

1. Transfers funds from payer account to escrow account via system call on Solana (no need for smart contract, simply use Solana CLI or Solana js library)
2. Construct a PDA hash table where the key is the payee public key and the values are "current amount of SOL", "end datetime", "last action datetime"

PDA Hash Table Visualization
| pub key address | (current amount of SOL, end datetime, last action datetime) |
| pub key address | (current amount of SOL, end datetime, last action datetime) |
| pub key address | (current amount of SOL, end datetime, last action datetime) |
| pub key address | (current amount of SOL, end datetime, last action datetime) |

// Withdrawals

1. Pass the public key to retrieve the values from the hash table
2. Acquire current timestamp from the clock account on Solana
3. Calculate rate of payout (current amount of sol / [end datetime - last action datetime])
4. Calculate difference between current timestamp and datetime of last action
5. Call transfer instructions that allows the payee to withdraw the appropriate amount
