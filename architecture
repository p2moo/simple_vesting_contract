// Front End User Experience
======================================

1. Payer inputs end datetime, payee public key, and the amount of SOL he wishes to deposit
2. Payer presses deposit
3. Sign transaction

======================================
// Smart Contract Architecture
======================================

// Deposits

1. Transfers funds from payer account to escrow account via system call on Solana (no need for smart contract, simply use Solana CLI or Solana js library)
2. Construct a PDA hash table where the key is the payee public key and the values are "current amount of SOL", "end datetime", "last action datetime"

PDA Hash Table Visualization
| [recipient_public_key] | [current_SOL] | [end_datetime] | [last_action_datetime] |
| [recipient_public_key] | [current_SOL] | [end_datetime] | [last_action_datetime] |
| [recipient_public_key] | [current_SOL] | [end_datetime] | [last_action_datetime] |

// Withdrawals

1. Pass the public key to retrieve the values from the hash table
2. Acquire current timestamp from the clock account on Solana
3. Calculate rate of payout (current amount of sol / [end datetime - last action datetime])
4. Calculate the amount of SOL that can be withdrawn ((current datetime - last action datetime) \* rate of payout)
5. Call transfer instructions that allows the payee to withdraw the appropriate amount
6. Update the current amount of SOL and last action datetime
7. If all the SOL is withdrawn, close vesting data account

// Cancellation

1. Depositor keys in Recepient public key
2. Depositor initiates to cancel the vesting (nobody else can cancel)
3. Check the current amount of SOL
4. Return the current amount of SOL to Depositor
5. Close vesting data account

// API

1. Get balance = current amount of SOL

TO-DO

next class - we are going to deploy contract
and simulate the whole process (real usecase)
we are going to write codes to interact with the contract
[or we can make a simple front end UI]

for lucas - how to make contract safer so it doesn't complain
